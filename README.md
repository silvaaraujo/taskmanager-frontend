# taskmanager-frontend  
A simple web application to manager a task list.  
  
  
This application was created to consume an API called taskmanager-backend, for studies about JWT authentication and authorization.  
  
  
This web app was developed using only pure HTML and CSS (some jquery was used too), and I used bootstrap to beautify the application.
